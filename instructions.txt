How to run sawyer robot container:
step 1:
#set ip and hostname
export SAWYER_HOSTNAME=021707CP00056.local
export WORKSTATION_IP=192.168.33.8
export SAWYER_IP=192.168.33.7

step 2:
#Build image(if required)
make build-nvidia-sawyer-robot

step 3:
#Run docker container. Opens Rviz with moveit
make run-nvidia-sawyer-robot

step 4:
#Enter into container terminal
docker exec -it sawyer-robot bash
#After this we can cd into root/ros_ws and execute the intera.sh file to run commands on sawyer

Step 5:
#To terminate image
(sudo) docker stop sawyer-robot

How to run script in garage:
step 1:
#set ip as before
#IMPORTANT TO RUN THIS BEFORE EXECUTING THE MAKE COMMAND

step 2:
#Run garage and python script
make run-garage-nvidia-ros

step 3:
#Go to code directory
cd ~/code/gym_sawyer/examples

step 4:
#Run code
python hello_world_sawyer.py

step 5:
#When opening another shell, run the following
export SAWYER_HOSTNAME=021707CP00056.local
export WORKSTATION_IP=192.168.33.8
export SAWYER_IP=192.168.33.7
source activate garage
export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLEW.so
export TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=3
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${HOME}/.mujoco/mjpro150/bin"
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://021707CP00056.local:11311

source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
source /root/ros_ws/devel/setup.bash
cd ~/ros_ws
./intera.sh
cd ~/code/

#The source commands in entrypoint initializes the correct environment to run the script. bash command, to open interactive shell with garage container is not working, otherwise we don't have to run ./intera.sh. We can run the sawyer robot docker in another container and just run garage container with the code(but right now the interfacing with the sawyer can happen from one container itself). If/when you want to remove ./intera.sh stuff, remember to export ROS_MASTER_URI in entrypoint

Sawyer names:-
- base_link/planning_frame = base
- robot.get_group_names() = ['right_arm']
- ee_link = right_gripper_tip



Updates:-
Using both containers separately(as in the gym_sawyer README) is working now for some reason
